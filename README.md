EAT-DA-BURGER!

This is a burger logger using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). We were instructed to follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in our app; and Handlebars to generate our HTML.

As a user, you can input the name of a burger you'd like to eat. You can eat burgers, or return them to the menu to be devoured by someone else. You can also delete burgers from the menu or devoured list.

Future development: I ran out of time to style the app. I'd like to return to this app to add a logo and style it.
